# XY

Simulate the [XY model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_XY_model) using webgl!
Hold down the mouse button to apply a force that attracts vortices and repels anti-vortices!
The vortices and anti-vortices are emergent topological excitations with long range (2d) Coulomb interactions, similar to real world electrons and positrons!

Try it!
